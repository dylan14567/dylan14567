# Dylan Meca

I'm Dylan Meca, scientist and computer engineer and an amateur computer programmer.

I have studied computer science and I learned more about the computer world and I learned about computer security and I realized that we can improve our systems through security tests to make them more secure. 🛡️

I am currently creating software, to improve technology and the future.
